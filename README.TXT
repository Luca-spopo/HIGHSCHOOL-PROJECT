Known bugs:

> puts function does not recognize the '\t' character as tab, and makes a circle instead.
> Sometimes text can appear deformatted and broken. There seem to be issues in strcpy. Since I do not know the internals of the string header, I cannot fix these. There is no recognizable pattern or method to bring these, and it happens randomly.
